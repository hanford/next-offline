## Serving service worker
Because service workers are so powerful, the API has some restrictions built in. For example, service workers must be served on the domain they're being used on - [you can't use a CDN](https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues/940).

### Now 1.0
You'll want to use the next.js custom server API. The easiest way to do that is creating a `server.js` that looks like this:
```js
const { createServer } = require('http')
const { join } = require('path')
const { parse } = require('url')
const next = require('next')

const app = next({ dev: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production' })
const handle = app.getRequestHandler()

app.prepare()
  .then(() => {
    createServer((req, res) => {
      const parsedUrl = parse(req.url, true)
      const { pathname } = parsedUrl

      // handle GET request to /service-worker.js
      if (pathname === '/service-worker.js') {
        const filePath = join(__dirname, '.next', pathname)

        app.serveStatic(req, res, filePath)
      } else {
        handle(req, res, parsedUrl)
      }
    })
    .listen(3000, () => {
      console.log(`> Ready on http://localhost:${3000}`)
    })
  })
```
You can  read more about custom servers in the [Next.js docs](https://github.com/zeit/next.js#custom-server-and-routing)

If you're not hosting with Now, I'd probably follow the Now 1.0 approach because the custom server API can enable a lot of functionality, it just simply doesn't work well with Now 2.0 üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Now 2.0
Because Now 2.0 works so different than the previous version, so does serving the service worker. There are a few different ways to do this, but I'd recommend checking out [this now2 example app](https://github.com/hanford/next-offline/tree/master/examples/now2). The changes to be aware of are in the [now.json](https://github.com/hanford/next-offline/blob/master/examples/now2/now.json) and [next.config.js](https://github.com/hanford/next-offline/blob/master/examples/now2/next.config.js).

## Registering service worker
### Compile-time registration
By default `next-offline` will register a service worker with the script below, this is automatically added to your client side bundle once `withOffline` is invoked.

```js
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  window.addEventListener('load', function () {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js', { scope: '/' }).then(function (registration) {
      console.log('SW registered: ', registration)
    }).catch(function (registrationError) {
      console.log('SW registration failed: ', registrationError)
    })
  })
}
```

### Runtime registration
Alternative to compile-time, you can take control of registering/unregistering in your application code by using the `next-offline/runtime` module.

```js
import { register, unregister } from 'next-offline/runtime'

class App extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount () {
    register()
  }
  componentWillUnmount () {
    unregister()
  }
  ..
}
```

If you're handling registration on your own, pass `dontAutoRegisterSw` to next-offline.
```js
// next.config.js
const withOffline = require('next-offline')

module.exports = withOffline({ dontAutoRegisterSw: true })
```

## Customizing service worker

### Using workbox

Define a `workboxOpts` object in your `next.config.js` and it will gets passed to [workbox-webpack-plugin](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-webpack-plugin#generatesw_plugin). Workbox is what `next-offline` uses under the hood to generate the service worker, you can learn more about it [here](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/).

```js
// next.config.js
const withOffline = require('next-offline')

const nextConfig = {
  workboxOpts: {
    ...
  }
}

module.exports = withOffline(nextConfig)
```

### next-offline options
On top of the workbox options, next-offline has some options built in flags to give you finer grain control over how your service worker gets generated.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Default</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>generateSw</td>
      <td>Boolean</td>
      <td>If false, next-offline will not generate a service worker and will instead try to modify workboxOpts.swSrc</td>
      <td>true</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>dontAutoRegisterSw</td>
      <td>Boolean</td>
      <td>If true, next-offline won't automatically push the registration script into the application code. This is required if you're using runtime registration or are handling registration on your own.</td>
      <td>false</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>devSwSrc</td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>Path to be registered by next-offline during development. By default next-offline will register a noop during development</td>
      <td>false</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>generateInDevMode</td>
      <td>Boolean</td>
      <td>If true, the service worker will also be generated in development mode. Otherwise the service worker defined in devSwSrc will be used.</td>
      <td>false</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>registerSwPrefix</td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>If your service worker isn't at the root level of your application, this can help you prefix the path. This is useful if you'd like your service worker on foobar.com/my/long/path/service-worker.js</td>
      <td>false</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>scope</td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>This is passed to the automatically registered service worker allowing increase or decrease what the service worker has control of.</td>
      <td>"/"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>transformManifest</td>
      <td>Function</td>
      <td>This is passed the manifest, allowing you to customise the list of assets for the service worker to precache.</td>
      <td>(manifest) => manifest</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Cache strategies
By default `next-offline` has the following blanket runtime caching strategy. If you customize `next-offline` with `workboxOpts`, the default behaviour will not be passed into `workbox-webpack-plugin`
```js
{
  globPatterns: ['static/**/*'],
  globDirectory: '.',
  runtimeCaching: { urlPattern: /^https?.*/, handler: 'networkFirst' }
}
```


```js
// next.config.js
const withOffline = require('next-offline')

module.exports = withOffline({
  workboxOpts: {
    runtimeCaching: [
      {
        urlPattern: /.png$/,
        handler: 'cacheFirst'
      },
      {
        urlPattern: /api/,
        handler: 'networkFirst',
        options: {
          cacheableResponse: {
            statuses: [0, 200],
            headers: {
              'x-test': 'true'
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
})
```

## Service worker path
If your application doesn't live on the root of your domain, you can use `registerSwPrefix`. This is helpful if your application is on domain.com/my/custom/path because by default `next-offline` assumes your application is on domain.com and will try to register domain.com/service-worker.js. We can't support using `assetPrefix` because service workers must be served on the root domain. For a technical breakdown on that limitation, see the following link: [Is it possible to serve service workers from CDN/remote origin?](https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues/940)

By default `next-offline` will precache all the Next.js webpack emitted files and the user-defined static ones (inside `/static`) - essentially everything that is exported as well.

If you'd like to include some more or change the origin of your static files use the given workbox options:

```js
workboxOpts: {
  globPatterns: ['app/static/**/*', 'any/other/fileglob/to/cache'],
  globDirectory: '.',
  modifyUrlPrefix: {
    'app': assetPrefix,
  },
  runtimeCaching: {...}
}
```

## Development mode
By default `next-offline` will add a no-op service worker in development. If you want to provide your own pass its filepath to `devSwSrc` option. This is particularly useful if you want to test web push notifications in development, for example.

```js
// next.config.js
const withOffline = require('next-offline')

module.exports = withOffline({
  devSwSrc: '/path/to/my/dev/service-worker.js'
})
```

You can disable this behavior by setting the `generateInDevMode` option to `true`.


## next export

In next-offline@3.0.0 we've rewritten the export functionality to work in more cases, more reliably, with less code thanks to some of the additions in Next 7.0.0!

You can read more about exporting at [Next.js docs]((https://github.com/zeit/next.js#static-html-export)) but next offline should Just Work‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.
